                <p><em>Time for essay recap no. 2! I wrote this essay in February for an english assignment examining that peculiar (pesky more like!) characteristic of human nature: insatiable desire (that means you never are satisfied). Being a secular school, all the non-believers had their work cut out for them — as for myself, I had a head start on the topic!</em></p>

                <p>Parents are well acquainted with the phenomenon — the week after Christmas their young toddlers and pre-teen kids, who had already enjoyed a spoilsome season, are forthwith drawn into the never-ending cycle of “if I get that toy, I’ll be happy forever.” Adults as well are befuddled by their ravenous desire for alternative (typically “better” to their understanding) circumstances and possesions. Yi-Fu Tuan verbalizes this peculiar trait of human nature: “Human beings have been and continue to be profoundly restless. For one reason or another, they are not content with being where they are. They move, or if they stay in one place, they seek to rearrange that place.”</p>

                <p><em>I wrote this essay last year as an ENGL 1102 assignment, and as it seems a waste not to put my old essays to some use, I will be starting a series that pulls from my more interesting assignments. Not too much red ink please, or I may relapse into essay revision stress disorder!</em></p>

                <p>Inevitably, the method or procedure through which reading comprehension is accomplished directly affects its retention and inward understanding. Additionally, depending on the context, the audience may strive for particular excellence in certain aspects while ignoring others. Obviously the purpose of reading will consequently determine the manner in which the composition is approached and noted. Multiple generic instances of this variability present themselves as prime candidates for observation.</p>
