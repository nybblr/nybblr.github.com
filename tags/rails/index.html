                <p><strong>TL;DR: Don’t manage vendor assets with Rails gems, use Bower and NPM. <a href="https://gist.github.com/nybblr/99f16afa33d71382a33b">Checkout the gist for quick reference.</a></strong></p>
                
                <p>So you’ve knocked out a few epics in Pivotal Tracker and have an MVP ready for Heroku, when your project manager announces that the Bootstrap-based frontend and choice of colors will likely turn off investors.</p>
                
                <p>To mitigate your “button-and-text soup,” he decides to hire a graphic designer and frontend developer to clobber your beautifully simple Rails app with masses of minified JavaScript, Convoluted Style Sheets, and litter your <code>slim</code> templates with classes and data attributes.</p>

                <p>Simplicity concerns concepts and divisions more that it does lines of code. But you probably didn’t hear that from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Johnson_(engineer)">Kelly Johnson.</a></p>
                
                <blockquote>
                  <p>Keep it simple stupid.</p>
                </blockquote>
                
                <p>The principle emphasizes that, contrary to what an average homegrown hacker might presume, complication isn’t a sign of brilliance: <em>it signals a lack of investment.</em> It shows the inability to break down and sift through the aspects of a problem domain to arrive at a solution that could be explained to a coworker in a couple sentences.</p>
                
                <p>The sad reality is no tool can assess (or automate) simplicity; <a href="https://codeclimate.com">CodeClimate</a> can’t tell me how well my knowledge boundaries are defined. Most of the time it does an impressive job at guessing through the causal relationship: a simpler model often yields simpler code. But not always.</p>
                
                <p>That’s what you as a developer are employed to do: to keep it <strong>truly</strong> simple, not <strong>just</strong> for stupid people.</p>

                <p><em>I know I know, it’s been close to a month since I last blogged — that’s because I’ve been working and feeling hobby-lazy on the weekends, and I’m still in the middle of writing an approximately 6–8 page (single spaced!) essay, so I’m a little preoccupied…</em></p>
                
                <h2 id="okay-whats-the-deal-with-ancestry">Okay, what’s the deal with Ancestry?</h2>
                <p>First off, it’s a slick and polished gem — strike one. Second, it addresses a very common need — strike two. Finally, it is Rails 3 savvy and efficient — home run!</p>
                
                <p>In all seriousness, Ancestry is perhaps one of the handiest gems I’ve used of late. Typically, setting up trees with ActiveRecord is relatively easy — but as the model logic grows, the ease of use/implementation fails. Query calls increase recursively with every layer of the tree, and scopes have to be manually called at each layer.</p>

                <p><em>Once again, I found myself beating my way through a website todo, and again I painfully managed to complete the task. Perhaps I can spare you some of that pain with this discussion of SSL.</em></p>
                
                <p>A nice convenience with the price of two late nights spent forcing my way through the seemingly most ridiculous bugs. What objective snatched away those precious hours of sleep?</p>
                
                <p>Forcing SSL. That’s it. I implemented an administrator interface to my blog so I can easily post, comment, etc. (or else I’d never get time to write) however I was bugged every time I saw the basic http auth dialog with its warning: <strong>Your password will be sent unencrypted.</strong></p>
                
                <p>Naturally, I’m a conspiracy theorist and anticipate some foreign nation overtaking my blog and using it to bring about the end of the world (ok not really). However, having to type in <code>https://</code> every time I want to securely do my magic jumbo gets really irritating, and too many times have I authenticated without SSL. Way too many times.</p>
