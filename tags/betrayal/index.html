                <p><em>Thanks to LaJoie Ward, a good friend of mine, you won’t have to listen to my ramblings alone. She’s an incredible Christian writer (her narratives are amazing!) and scholar. If you enjoy her work as much as I do, check out her personal blog <a href="http://thoughtsofjoy17.blogspot.com">Thought of Joy.</a></em></p>
                
                <p>Your character is who you are inside; it’s created in the small moments but comes out when you’re under pressure.</p>
                
                <p>Judas and Peter were both with Jesus for three and a half years. They both heard his teachings, traveled with him, and did his bidding. And they both committed terrible betrayals against Jesus. But these men’s lives ended in drastically different ways. Judas, filled with guilt at the realization of what he had done, went out and hung himself. Peter, though he was sorrowful for having disowned his master and friend, was sincerely repentant, and was welcomed back by Jesus after the resurrection. What made the difference?</p>
