          </header>
          <section>
            <p>So, in your wanderings and redirects across cyberspace you found me: your (almost) average Georgia Tech senior with a fierce aptitude for hobbies in quantity. Graphic/print/web design, coding in the masses, photography, violin performance, writing fiction works, dance, and even an occasional cheesy dish with garnish — I have a healthy appreciation for it all.</p>
            
            <p>Why are you going to actually <em>finish</em> reading through this sub-standard about page? Because you are thoroughly interested in how I contrast my duplicity of occupations with a singularity of beliefs. <em>Or at least I presumed so.</em></p>
            
            <h1 id="whats-most-important-to-you">What’s most important to you?</h1>
            <p>I’m a Christian — that means I am in a life-changing relationship with Christ and follow His teachings as defined solely in the Scriptures. What’s the big deal about a Jewish carpenter who shook up Jerusalem two millennia ago? Actually, why <em>wouldn’t</em> it be a big deal? It’s not everyday God’s Son comes to earth, lives, dies, and rises back to life for my sake. So scold me if I don’t make a big enough deal about it — our world is chaos without the foundation He gave us.</p>
            
            <p>So I recommend you also get acquainted with Him; He knows how to fix broken things, and people are His specialty. It doesn’t mean you won’t make colossal failures (see <a href="#now-about-those-colossal-failures">Appendix A: colossal failures</a>) — but hang in there till eternity, and then you can drop “face palm” from your vocabulary. That’s just a nice side effect of knowing Him; <a href="/pages/why-christ">maybe you’d like to get better acquainted?</a></p>
            
            <h2 id="and-the-fruit-of-that-relationship">And the fruit of that relationship?</h2>
            <p>God is creative — big time (He created us, so He’s a master at it), so in getting to know His Son, I get a healthy dose of creativity here and there. Cue header.</p>
            
            <h1 id="what-are-you-good-at">What are you good at?</h1>
            
            <p>Didn’t you read the first paragraph? Oh well, now you’re in for the non-condensed version. For your sanity, I’ll give you some sub-headers by which you can breeze through the relevant credentials.</p>
            
            <h2 id="coding">Coding</h2>
            <p>So first off, I love Unix based computers — Mac, Linux, Ubuntu, they rock. Throw in a love of robotics and a soft spot for devices, and you get a multitude of programming languages with next to nil circuitry experience. I code in:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Ruby (the language of the future)</li>
              <li>C (yep, just plain ol’ ‘99 C)</li>
              <li>Objective-C (after yielding to C, why not supersets?)</li>
              <li>Java (disclaimer: I hate Java. But I’m really good with it thanks to GT courses and Android development)</li>
              <li>Bash (I love my terminal, and an occasional Bash utility is an exciting thing)</li>
              <li>JavaScript</li>
              <li>CoffeeScript (which rocks)</li>
              <li>All your other standard web dev languages: HTML5, CSS 3/SASS</li>
              <li>LabVIEW (we have to start somewhere, right?)</li>
              <li>MatLab (only when forced)</li>
              <li>Just enough PHP to modify a database query string (which doesn’t interest me in the least)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Oh by the way, yes I do all of my coding in my souped up, custom-compiled Vim (well, now I use MacVim actually). It’s awesome, and I recommend you type <code>$ vimtutor</code> to get started yourself.</p>
            
            <h2 id="photography">Photography</h2>
            <p>Yes I have a life outside coding. After all, you are at my photography and faith blog, so you might deduce that I fancy myself a photographer.</p>
            
            <p>I started about a year ago with my first DSLR (a Canon T2i) and the cheapy 50mm — it’s been an exciting journey since then! I’ve gotten to do a few paid shoots recently, tons of portraiture and a little bit of mediocre macro photography. I’ve upgraded my equipment with some bags, filters, and the ever-so-awesome 70-200mm f/4 L USM. I’m still on the T2i for budgetary reasons (I’m a college student, give me time), but after I am able to add the 24-70mm f/2.8 to my arsenal, you can be sure the just-discontinued (and hence cheaper!) Canon 5D Mk II will be on my wish-list.</p>
            
            <p>So I know you’re dying to schedule a shoot with me, especially if you’re here in the Atlanta, GA region and love good, wild portraits. Really, you do. <a href="/pages/contact-me">Get in touch and we’ll talk photos.</a></p>
            
            <h2 id="graphics">Graphics</h2>
            <p>I spend a lot of my time in Photoshop doing web mockups, print material designs, and random wallpapers that mock my favorite color (orange). When time becomes an available asset, I’ll give dribbble a shot and see how I fare in that awesome community. You can see a very limited subset of <a href="http://forr.st/-nybblr">some of my stuff at Forrst</a> if you are really curious.</p>
            
            <h2 id="violin">Violin</h2>
            <p>Yeah, a CS major really needs some music in his life — usually they pick trumpet. But I was a musician before I started coding, so I picked a <em>real</em> instrument. I’ve been classically trained for 7 years (that’s means I didn’t pick up the Dummies guide to learning violin and just hope I would learn it right) and have been performing for 8. I got my minor in violin performance at Kennesaw State University (they have an incredible music program by the way) and studied under Helen Kim. Prior to my undergraduate studies, I studied with the ASO’s principal second-violinist David Arenz.</p>
            
            <p>Nowadays I do a lot of performance: I have a handful of gigs throughout the year, like weddings, business lunch engagements, pre-concert entertainment, etc. Some other performance friends and I have started a string quartet called <a href="http://4thee.com">4thee</a> that you really ought to consider hiring for your wedding — we play awesome stuff. Then again, if you want Aaron Copland’s Rodeo to be played solo for the recessional, you should talk to me several months in advance so I can set you straight.</p>
            
            <h2 id="writing">Writing</h2>
            <p>You’re reading this page, aren’t you? No, this is not how I usually write — my dissertational articles require a much broader vocabulary and the exclusion of “so.” I love writing creative fiction (which you will probably never see in a book) with dripping sarcasm and succulent adjectives (I am writing this on an empty stomach). So go have a read at whatever articles suit your fancy — or if none of them do, just click whatever is on the front page and force yourself to read it. A dictionary is a great asset to have nearby.</p>
            
            <h1 id="what-interests-you">What interests you?</h1>
            <p>You mean other than what I’m good at? Umm, well, hmmm…waltzing?</p>
            
            <h2 id="places-to-go-people-to-see">Places to go, people to see</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="http://manuscriptmastr.com">manuscriptmastr.com</a> — you guessed it, we’re related! Joshua is my twin brother (no, we are actually <em>completely</em> different); he plays a mean round of Grieg and Rachmaninoff, so if you are interested in music or piano you should check him out.</li>
              <li><a href="http://thoughtsofjoy17.blogspot.com">thoughtsofjoy17.blogspot.com</a> — personal blog of LaJoie Ward, an incredibly gifted writer and good friend of mine.</li>
              <li><a href="http://jameslex.com">jameslex.com</a> — another blog, run by (who else?) James Lex, a long-time friend and tech cohort; amazing memorization capacity too.</li>
              <li><a href="http://forrst.com">forrst.com</a> — an awesome designer/developer community forum of sorts; “litter free” and Rails powered!</li>
              <li><a href="http://premiumpixels.com">premiumpixels.com</a> — one of my favorite websites for inspirational freebies! Orman Clark served as a great source of ideas to me when I was developing this website.</li>
              <li><a href="http://weather.com">weather.com</a> — let’s face it, if you really got this far down the list, we need to talk about the weather; I detest the iPhone app and their website needs an optimization team, but other than that it’s useful during tornado watches…</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h1 id="describe-your-personality">Describe your personality.</h1>
            <p>You really don’t want me to describe myself; but because you begged and pleaded so: I prefer to be the literary king of verbal irony, not the sarcastic jerk you take summer classes with (no, I have no one specific in mind). I love people (usually) and socializing (in person, not Facebook), am a bit of a perfectionist (did you notice any typos or comma splices?), and am passionate about the interests God has given me — especially when I’m sitting in MATH 3215.</p>
            
            <h2 id="i-want-random-stuff-really-random">I want random stuff. Really random.</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>I like white</li>
              <li>More screen is better. I’ll find a way to use it all.</li>
              <li>I’m not bad with a ripstik</li>
              <li>Three point one four one five nine two six five three five eight nine seven nine (to 50 digits)</li>
              <li>You’ll find The Lord of the Rings trilogy by my bedside.</li>
              <li>I harbor severe dislike for sharp pointy needles in my arm.</li>
              <li>I still have my old K’NEX (they’re great for desk accessories actually)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h1 id="now-about-those-colossal-failures">Now about those colossal failures…</h1>
            <p>Maybe another day. I’ve had enough embarrassment from just admitting that.</p>
