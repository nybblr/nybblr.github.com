                <p>After developing a number of Rails 3 apps, I’ve come to build up a list of “prerequisite” gems that I must install before I decide to include anything else.</p>
                
                <p>Without further ado, here are my top 10 must have gems for RESTful, DRY development.</p>
                
                <h2 id="simpleform">simple_form</h2>
                <p>Let’s face it: as awesome as Rails is, form building is not exactly its forte. That’s why I recommend <code>simple_form</code>, a gem that makes form partials a breeze to customize, generate, and understand. With support for native I18n, inline validations, nested models, extensive options, and unbeatable customization, <code>simple_form</code> is a serious deal for forms.</p>

                <p><em>I wrote this essay last year as an ENGL 1102 assignment, and as it seems a waste not to put my old essays to some use, I will be starting a series that pulls from my more interesting assignments. Not too much red ink please, or I may relapse into essay revision stress disorder!</em></p>

                <p>Inevitably, the method or procedure through which reading comprehension is accomplished directly affects its retention and inward understanding. Additionally, depending on the context, the audience may strive for particular excellence in certain aspects while ignoring others. Obviously the purpose of reading will consequently determine the manner in which the composition is approached and noted. Multiple generic instances of this variability present themselves as prime candidates for observation.</p>

                <p><em>Another tip (err hurdle) I came across during the production of this blog — truncating an HTML string. Easy, right?</em></p>
                
                <p>It seems simple enough: shorten some basic text content from a long entry. It’s extremely popular in blogs, catalogs, portfolios, etc. and with good reason — the average browser wants to find content through screening, not mass scrolling.</p>
                
                <p>But a good trimmer must keep a few things in mind.</p>
                
                <ul>
                  <li>Don’t split words</li>
                  <li>Recognize/respect HTML tags</li>
                  <li>Parse HTML according to standards</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>These add up to some pretty terse requirements once you actually get to coding. First, unless we want to manually parse HTML, we’ll have to use some standards based parser and loop through all the elements, until the specified number of characters/words (excluding tags!) is exceeded, at which point we append a user-defined tail and discard all other tags.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Update:</strong> <em>the latest version of this handy widget is now available as a gem! Check it out at <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/butter">rubygems.org/gems/butter</a> or bundle it with gem install butter.</em></p>

                <p><em>Figures, I wanted to reply to a comment and ended up writing a four-page essay! As that is certainly a little lengthy for a reply, I decided to expand it into an article so I could more fully (though it is still severely incomplete) address the topics of Calvinism, free will, predestination, etc.</em></p>
                
                <p>I’ve been surprised by the amount of discussion generated by <a href="/2011/04/24/two-sinners-and-a-saint">Two Sinners and a Saint;</a> I think however the discussion should be turned from a Calvinism/Arminianism to a more relevant discussion of that article topic, as the purpose of this blog and the comments is not to be a forum that trails off on side topics.</p>
                
                <p>That being said, I would like to “throw my hat in the ring” with my thoughts on the subject.</p>
